## Purpose
Counting to five is hard enough. Counting to 30 is next to impossible. Counting 
anything more than 30 requires powerful computers or elite console players to 
be even remotely within the realm of possibility.

But fret no longer! There is an addon to count your long cooldowns for you.

## Features
- Only enables tracking/display when an included set is equipped or synergy is toggled on
- Reposition to any place on your screen
- Resize display from really small to comically large
- Optionally hide when out of combat
- Play sound on proc (enabled by default)
- Play sound when off cooldown (enabled by default)
- Includes around 100 different sounds to choose from

## Implemented Cooldowns
Sets:
- Earthgore
- Magicka Furnace
- Shroud of the Lich
- Trappings of Invigoration
- Vestment of Olorime
- Vestments of the Warlock
- Wyrd Tree's Blessing

Synergies:
- Blood Altar
- Boner Shield
- Conduit
- Purify
- Orbs / Shards

## Addtional Sets
If you'd like to see a specific set added, please let me know. I would prefer to 
limit the sets to ones with long cooldowns and those not already covered by other 
more well-done addons, but this is not a hard rule.

# Enjoy!
